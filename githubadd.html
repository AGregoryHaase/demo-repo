    <h1>Will this push to my GitHub?</h1>

    <section>
        <p>right, so what the fuck am I actaully doing. 
            I'm really pissed off with myself as this is the first time today that I'm sitting down at my computer to 
            do some coding.
            I'm really annoyed with myself. I did loads yesterday. Did I burn out? 
            In a day? 
            What the fuck dude. 
            ANyway, let's see if this turns up on my GitHub. 
            CAn you remember how to push to the GitHub?
            IS it git push . ?
            wait, to check what is new I type git status. It says the working tree is clean.  
        </p>
        <p>
            I've added a new file, this one. Wait, I haven't added it to the staging area though. 
                I have to do git add . then git commit
        </p>
        <p>
            OKay, I did that. Git add ., then git commit -m "adding github?.html"
            Let's see if it's in the repo on github.
            Right, nope. It's on my local machine. 
            I'm actully quite chuffed as I pretty quickly remembered that I forgot to push it. 
            Now then, is it git push? just git push? or do I have to specify? Let's try it and see what happens.
        </p>
        <p>
            RIght, I've managed to do that. Let's see if it's there.
        </p>
        <p>
            Smashing stuff, it's there. But it doesn't seem to have the changes I've made since the second paragraph. Why could 
            that be happening???
        </p>
        <p>
            vaaart zeee faaaac. It only has the changes up until line 30. What's going on????
        </p>
        <p>oh my days, I have to PUUUUUUSSHHHHHH!!!! 
            Let's see if that works.
        </p>
