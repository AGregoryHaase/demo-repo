    <h1>Will this push to my GitHub?</h1>

    <section>
        <p>right, so what the fuck am I actaully doing. 
            TIme now is 7pm on 9th March.
            I'm really pissed off with myself as this is the first time today that I'm sitting down at my computer to 
            do some coding.
            I'm really annoyed with myself. I did loads yesterday. Did I burn out? 
            In a day? (I'm re-reading this later and I'm probs being a bit harsh on myself, more on this later)
            What the fuck dude. 
            ANyway, let's see if this turns up on my GitHub. 
            CAn you remember how to push to the GitHub?
            IS it git push . ?
            wait, to check what is new I type git status. It says the working tree is clean.  
        </p>
        <p>
            I've added a new file, this one. Wait, I haven't added it to the staging area though. 
                I have to do git add . then git commit
        </p>
        <p>
            OKay, I did that. Git add ., then git commit -m "adding github?.html"
            Let's see if it's in the repo on github.
            Right, nope. It's on my local machine. 
            I'm actully quite chuffed as I pretty quickly remembered that I forgot to push it. 
            Now then, is it git push? just git push? or do I have to specify? Let's try it and see what happens.
        </p>
        <p>
            RIght, I've managed to do that. Let's see if it's there.
        </p>
        <p>
            Smashing stuff, it's there. But it doesn't seem to have the changes I've made since the second paragraph. Why could 
            that be happening???
        </p>
        <p>
            vaaart zeee faaaac. It only has the changes up until line 30. What's going on????
        </p>
        <p>oh my days, I have to PUUUUUUSSHHHHHH!!!! 
            Let's see if that works. It worked!! Happy days.
        </p>

            <p>cool beans!</p>
            <p>Right, so the time now is 2am on Thursday the tenth of March. I was feeling kind of annoyed at myself earlier
                for not doing any coding until 7pm. I was probably being a bit harsh. I had watched a youtube video on APIs
                while i was working out in the morning. I went and met Rach Han after a little walk into town. 
                I think I needed to get out of the house as I'd been coding for like 4 days and little else. 
                Anyway, I woke up at around 12:30am due to my housemate banging around. 
                I decided to just grab my laptop and have a look. I added, committed and pushed some files to demo-repo.
                Then I've just been reading myfirstgit.html 
                It's pretty cool to have these little diarys to read and recap what I've been doing. 
                It also helps me to realise that actually I have been doing quite a bit. 
                I think sometimes it can feel like you're not really making progress or you're not really working hard enough.
                It's also really cool to see all the obstacles that I've faced and managed to figure out and the process of doing that. 
            </p>
            <p>
                OKay, so next I need to recap how to pull. and one other thing....bah I can't rememeber. 
                I remember that touch is to create a new file. 
                Clone brings in a repo from github.
                what else? WHat else was it I wanted to recap?
                Anyway, pull is when you've edited in github and you then want to pull it into git and vscode locally. 
                
            </p>
            <p>
                It's now 0410 10th March. 
                <a href="todo.html">I've just created a todo list which is here.</a> 
            </p>

    <section>
        <h3>10th March 10am</h3>
        <p>Right then, went back to sleep at around 4:30 after creating that todo list. 
            Woke up at half 8 to Porsha, my house mate, asking me to drop her to her job in Derby. 
            Absolute liberty! &#128540; 
            Ayyy, I just used my first emoji in code. 
        </p> 
        <p>
            OKay, so what am I doing? I've just learned how to link between two pages. Well, I had done it before but had forgotten. 
            Only took me two googles to find the docs on how to do it. Very simple, just put the file name in the href.
            OKay, So I want to make repos for my learning projects. 
            I think I should start by linking the myfirstgit.html colt steele section out to it's own file contained
            in a folder inside a new repo for the course. 
        </p>
        <p>I think I should do this by creating a new repo in github. Or should I try doing it in the terminal? 
            No I'll just do it on the hub.
        </p>
        <p>Okay, I've created the repo. I need to pull it down to VSCode. 
            I also need to create a link to the first file from myfirstgit.html.
            OKay, how do I pull dthe new repo down. Clone. Clone what? 
            Off the top of my noggin it's git clone name of repo. 
            Let me look at docs before i try.
            Right I am really not sure about this. I need to get my head around where the folder will be created. 
            Is it going into the hidden .git folder?
            I'm going to go ahead and do it. HOpefully it won't fuck up what I've done so far. It probably will. ha!
        </p>
        <p>I just went ahead and typed git clone to see what would happen. It came up with the following 
            <blockquote>

        </p>
        <p>Oh yeah, I just looked at the docs and you just use the url. 
            Okay, let's try it
        </p>
        <p>
            Okay, that's cool but it has cloned the repo into the demo-repo folder. 
            I need to do a cd but I don't know where to do the cd to? Maybe to the parent folder of the demo-repo folder.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ah right, I've just looked at the finder and the parent folder is the GIT folder. I should have seen that. So, if I go to the GIT fol
        OKay, so how do I move the newly cloned folder up into the GIT folder?
        OKay, I gave in and just used the GUI. I have to balance making progress with learning new stuff. 
        I'm sure I'll figure it out soon. Okay, let me check if I can actually still push and pull to the new 
        repo
        </p>
        <p>
            Bloody hell I just tried to create a new file in the new repo but it put it into the demo-repo. 
            I need to change directory. 
            I just hit cd and it put into the main folder. I don't want to be there. 
            How the eff do I get into my new colt folder?
            I've created the new html file for the intro to the course but I can't push it until i'm in the right folder.
            Let me google this ish.
        </p>
        <p>So it's cd and then the name of the folder. 
            I managed to change to the demo-repo, but when I tried to change to.....scrap that.
            I just typed cd and then dragged the fodler down. I'm in it now
            happy days!
        </p>
        <p>
            Oh my days, I have to create a new shh key for the new repo. OKay, I used the same key. I added it using the documentation found in myfirstgit.html. 
            However it won't log in. I changed directory and can still push from demo-repo. 
            Maybe I just need to create a whole new key for the new repo. 
            Let me do that now then.
            Right I've not been able to do it but I need to move on. 
            Let me go back to the demo-repo and see if i can still push. I'm betting I can't.
        </p>
        <p>I can, thank goodness. It's added in a file though - .ds.store. NO idea where that came from. And It's actually gone 
            from the demo-repo on my local and into my github. Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
            Okay, I am feeling pretty lsot. Lost, although lsot is fitting. I've been doing this bloody github thing since this morning again and it's now 1pm. 
            I need to go back and look at my todo. 

        </p>
        <p>
        Maybe I should just move the new repo back into the demo repo so that I can push and pull? Let me try.
        Nope, still wants me to sign in for effs sake.
        I've moved it back out of the demo-repo.
        </p> 
        <p>
            Right so I just followed the promt (when I put in git push) that opened up asking to link vscode and github. I 
            thought I'd already done that but hey ho. I did it and now it works, no problem. Infact, let me see if I can create a new repo and then push to it??
        </p>
        <p>OKay, cool I just created a new repo for my files from the web dev bootcamp. I created it in the terminal, and pushed it to github.
            Now I just need to push all theose files I've worked on to it. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Woahhh, I've added the section 10 html and css files and pushed them to the hub. 
            NOw I can watch that video on gitpages. In to bonuns points right now I think!!!
            Let's have a go!
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COxGHDYV4aY">Here is the video</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Right, think it's actually quicker to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site" target="blank">read the docs.</a>  
            Okay, here goes. I should make another repo for learning the pages ahaa!
        </p>
        <p>
            Right, I've fully hit the wall. Just want my bed but I need to get up and walk around a bit. 
            I want to go for a run or to the gym but really cba. It's 430pm. 
            I've been sat here since 930am. PLus the stint I did from 1230am to 430am. So, so far today
            I've done 11 hours. 
        </p>
        <p>OKay, It's now Friday 11th Match at 9:10am. 
            I managed to get my ass to the gym last night. 
            Walked there. To Garth's. Started off just feeling like I wanted to go home but soon got into it and it turned into a mega session. 
            Jogged/walked back home.
        </p>
        <p>Unfortunately I have this morning, somehow, cricked my neck while having my morning coffee. So That's a little annoying. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I have to leave in a couple of hours to get Claude. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm just going to try and get this website thing done. I'll be happy if I get that done. 
        </p>
        <p>Okay, the time is now 10:15 and guess what? I've done it. The pages are not perfect and some elements are not working properly.
            I'll have to come back and have a look at what is wrong there. 
            For now though, here are the page 
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://agregoryhaase.github.io/GitHubPages/#101" target="blank">Section 10</a> </li>
                <li><a href="https://agregoryhaase.github.io/WedDevSec9/" target="blank">Section 9</a> </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Well, it's taken me about a week of learning. I think I've gotten my head around the basics of Git and GitHub, using the terminal and also the VSCode terminal.
            That's pretty cool. 
            Obviously I've not made any progress in my web dev course but I can get back onto that now and continue using Git with it. Bonus. 
            Pretty chuffed. 
            Right, I'm off to get Claude. 
            Just realised section 9 doesn't have my font. bahh.
        </p>

        <h2>11 March 2022</h2>
        <p>
            Right, I've made it to London. I'm sat in the Odeon Cinema on Holloway Road, waiting for school to finish. 
            It's so, so nice in here. Wow, I think I'll try and come here again. 
            I only have about ten mins but I thought I'd get the laptop out and have a look. 
            I need to collate all these little diaries. Or Do I. Should I just leave them all in their respective repos? 
            Who knows. 
            I'm sure I'll figure it out. Come on brain, come up with a solution please.
            I was reading my section 9 stuff that I put online. Lots of swearing. I think I was a bit frustrated. 
            I do swear when I get frustrated, like a lot of people. I hope no-one is offended. Ha, image me supposing that anyone is actually going to read it.
            I actually need to create a repo for all my previous work in the bootcamp. No, wait, I already did that. I need to add the files to it. 
            OKay, let's see if I can do that now.
